Returns the encoding associated with the specified code page name.
Namespace:  System.Text
Assembly:  mscorlib (in mscorlib.dll)
Syntax
C#C++F#VB
public static Encoding GetEncoding(
	string name
)
Parameters
name
Type: System.String
The code page name of the preferred encoding. Any value returned by the WebName property is valid. Possible values are listed in the Name column of the table that appears in the Encoding class topic.
Return Value
Type: System.Text.Encoding
The encoding associated with the specified code page.
Exceptions
Exception	Condition
ArgumentException	
name is not a valid code page name.
-or-
The code page indicated by name is not supported by the underlying platform.
Remarks
The fallback handler depends on the encoding type of name. If name is a code page or double-byte character set (DBCS) encoding, a best-fit fallback handler is used. Otherwise, a replacement fallback handler is used. These fallback handlers may not be appropriate for your application. To specify the fallback handler used by the encoding specified by name, you can call the GetEncoding(String, EncoderFallback, DecoderFallback) overload.
The GetEncoding method relies on the underlying platform to support most code pages. However, the .NET Framework natively supports some encodings.
NoteNote
The ANSI code pages can be different on different computers, or can be changed for a single computer, leading to data corruption. For the most consistent results, applications should use Unicode, such as UTF-8 (code page 65001) or UTF-16, instead of a specific code page.
For a list of code pages, see the Encoding class topic. The application uses the GetEncodings method to get a list of all encodings.
GetEncoding returns a cached instance with default settings. The application should use the constructors of derived classes to get an instance with different settings. For example, the UTF32Encoding class provides a constructor that lets you enable error detection.
Examples
The following example gets two instances of the same encoding (one by code page and another by name), and checks their equality.
C#C++VB
using System;
using System.Text;

public class SamplesEncoding  {

   public static void Main()  {

      // Get a UTF-32 encoding by codepage.
      Encoding e1 = Encoding.GetEncoding( 12000 );

      // Get a UTF-32 encoding by name.
      Encoding e2 = Encoding.GetEncoding( "utf-32" );

      // Check their equality.
      Console.WriteLine( "e1 equals e2? {0}", e1.Equals( e2 ) );

   }

}


/* 
This code produces the following output.

e1 equals e2? True

*/
